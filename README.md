Shadow is a game engine built on lua and raylib with the goal of being easy to use and easy to port. 

## Requirements
[Raylib 4.0.0](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/tag/4.0.0) (Get source code download)  
[Lua 5.4.2](http://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/) (use release 1)  
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (peferably)  
### Windows
[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) (Need for make, gcc, and libraries)  
### MacOS

**Shadow will not support 32 bit systems**  
## Setup
### Windows
1. Install MSYS2. It will default to: `C:\msys64`
### VSCode

- Model management
- Shader management
- Lua implementation
- Entity/Environment management (Stage Play)
